Unofficial template for a bachelor thesis of the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts

LaTeX template for the documentation of a bachelor thesis in German language. This template was created with the intention to help others. 
I suggest Texmaker as the software of choice to create the documents, more information available here: https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/ 

Basic high level document structure:
* Cover page
* Title page
* Table of content
* Abbreviations
* Main documentation, split up into different files
* Appendix

Creating a PDF from the LaTeX documents: 
* Run BibTeX (F11)
* Run MakeIndex (F12)
* Run Quickbuild or equivalent (F1)

Sometimes, a second or third cycle is required to get all references right.
